**Task 1: Traffic flow aware inference attacks.** Thinking like an adversary, we propose a new threat model that leverages traffic flow information to recover vehicles’ exact locations from other types of information, such as braking signals or perturbated locations. We describe the target vehicle’s mobility by a *hidden Markov model (HMM)* (Figure 1), and then track the vehicle’s exact locations using the Viterbi algorithm (Figure 2).

    Figure 1. HMM model: the vehicle’s exact location is considered as a hidden state, while its sensing information/perturbated location is considered as an observable state; the HMM transition matrix, which can be learnt using the traffic flow information, describes the probabilities of the vehicle traveling between the locations over the map.

**Task 2: Location obfuscation over the road networks**. Considering that individual vehicles’ mobility is restricted by various road environments, including traffic flows and local road network topology, our objective is to design time-efficient obfuscation techniques to protect vehicles' location privacy against the traffic-aware inference attacks.
